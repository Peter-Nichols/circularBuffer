# circularBuffer
A basic implementation of a circular buffer (ring buffer) using C++

This implementation assumes that the buffer will not be resized dynamically.

The buffer size is fixed at construction time.

The buffer can be used for any type of data by changing the std::vector<int> to std::vector<T> and modifying the class accordingly.
